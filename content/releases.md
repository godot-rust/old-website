# [0.9.3 - 2021-02-03](@/release-notes/0-9-3.md)

0.9.3 is an incremental release with improvements in documentation and API completeness. `GodotString` supports more operations, and support is added for a few common patterns.

The 0.9.2 version is skipped and yanked from crates.io due to an bug that was undetected due to a rustc regression.
