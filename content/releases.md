# [0.9.0 - 2020-09-20](@/release-notes/0-9-0.md)

The 0.9.0 release consists of a massive redesign of the godot-rust API in order to solve long-standing soundness problems in the old API. 0.9.0 contains numerous breaking changes from previous versions. To help users update their code, we have created a [migration guide from godot-rust 0.8.x in the user guide](https://godot-rust.github.io/book/migrating-0-8.html).

This release is made from tag [`0.9.0`](https://github.com/godot-rust/godot-rust/tree/0.9.0), commit [`a370645`](https://github.com/godot-rust/godot-rust/commit/a370645363b85e10d3f1a49cd127174a4fb6bad9).
