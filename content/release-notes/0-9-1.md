# Introduction

0.9.1 is an incremental release with mostly bug fixes since the 0.9.0 release. There are also a few new features, thanks to contributions:

[@Robert7301201](https://github.com/Robert7301201) and [@otaviopace](https://github.com/otaviopace) have implemented missing mathematic methods on [`Plane`](https://github.com/godot-rust/godot-rust/pull/620) and [`Vector2`](https://github.com/godot-rust/godot-rust/pull/611). It's now easier to port GDScript code that deal with geometric types to Rust.

[@TylerMartinez](https://github.com/TylerMartinez) has [added support](https://github.com/godot-rust/godot-rust/pull/593) for Godot RPC modes for exported methods. It's now possible to set RPC modes with the `#[export]` attribute when using the `#[methods]` macro:

```rust
#[methods]
impl Foo {
    #[export(rpc = "remote_sync")]
    fn foo(&self, _owner: &Node) {
        // - snip -
    }
}
```

A list of RPC modes can be found in the [Godot documentation](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_multiplayerapi.html#enumerations). Note that only non-deprecated modes are supported, and the names are converted to `snake_case`, with an underscore inserted before `sync` for modes that end with it.

This release is made from tag [`0.9.1`](https://github.com/godot-rust/godot-rust/tree/0.9.1), commit [`97a0b41`](https://github.com/godot-rust/godot-rust/commit/97a0b4110449862716fb25cc3fea9d01c4da5553).

## 

# Changelog

## Added

- Support for RPC modes using the `export` attribute, e.g. `#[export(rpc = "remote_sync")]`.

- Added the convenience method `Vector2Godot::clamped`.

- Added Godot-equivalent methods for `Plane`.

## Fixed

- Fixed a problem where incorrect documentation may be generated when building from case-insensitive file systems.

- Fixed a case of undefined behavior when `Instance::new` is called for non-tool scripts in the editor.

- Fixed a type mismatch problem that may prevent compilation on some target platforms.

- Fixed potential compilation error in case of `TypeId` widening.
