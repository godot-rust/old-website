# Introduction

0.9.3 is an incremental release with improvements in documentation and API completeness. Since 0.9.1 was released, we have received many great contributions that make this release possible:

[@Bromeon](https://github.com/Bromeon) implemented a [minimal parser](https://github.com/godot-rust/godot-rust/pull/642) for Godot's custom documentation BBCode, greatly improving the readability of generated API docs. He had also made improvements to the error messages and docs on existing types, making the library much more friendly!

[@extrawurst](https://github.com/extrawurst) [added](https://github.com/godot-rust/godot-rust/pull/674) the `#[property(no_editor)]` flag for the property macro, which exports properties that can be accessed from other languages like GDScript, but aren't shown in the editor.

[@Aceeri](https://github.com/Aceeri) implemented [many standard traits](https://github.com/godot-rust/godot-rust/pull/596) for the `GodotString` type, making it much more useful. While `GodotString`s are costly to modify, they are great for engine-related things that don't need to change, like paths, symbols, or keys.

We also have quite a few new examples: [@leiter-jakab](https://github.com/leiter-jakab) created an example for [Godot networking](https://github.com/godot-rust/godot-rust/tree/0.9.3/examples/rpc), [@CraigCiccone](https://github.com/CraigCiccone) created an example for [custom Node plugins](https://github.com/godot-rust/godot-rust/tree/0.9.3/examples/native_plugin), and [@damszew](https://github.com/damszew) added the example for [exporting custom resources](https://github.com/godot-rust/godot-rust/tree/0.9.3/examples/resource).

Under the hood, [@halzy](https://github.com/halzy) completed the [herculean task](https://github.com/godot-rust/godot-rust/pull/662) of updating the library's many proc-macros to emit compile errors, and added build tests for them. Really awesome!

There are many more, and while only a few of them are called out here, all contributions are very appreciated!

One of the very often wanted feature from the crate is a utility function to get and cast a node from the scene tree in one call. While this has been available as an extension trait in one of the examples, it was hard to find, and it felt bad to copy-paste into projects. Now, the `NodeExt` trait is part of `gdnative-bindings` and the prelude:

```rust
use gdnative::prelude::*;
// - snip -
#[export]
fn foo(&self, owner: TRef<Node>) -> i32 {
    // `unsafe` is still needed, but a safe reference is returned directly, since it was necessary for the cast in the first place.
    let sub_node: TRef<'_, _> = unsafe {
        owner.get_node_as::<Spatial>("path/to/node").unwrap()
    };

    // Same for sub-nodes as instances of NativeScript classes.
    let sub_instance: RefInstance<'_, _, Shared> = unsafe {
        owner.get_node_as_instance::<MyScriptClass>("path/to/other").unwrap()
    };
    
    do_thing_with(sub_node, sub_instance)
}
```

There is also a shortcut for auto-load "singletons" under the root node:

```rust
use gdnative::prelude::*;
// - snip -
#[export]
fn bar(&self, _owner: TRef<Node>) -> i32 {
    // Same as the `get_node_as` method.
    let music_player: TRef<'_, _> = unsafe {
        autoload::<AudioStreamPLayer>("music_player").unwrap()
    };

    do_thing_with(music_player)
}
```

Previously, to create scripts that contain values only possible to construct in Rust, one had to declare a separate type, wrap it in `Option`, and implement their own error handling. Now, this pattern is supported by the library directly with the `#[no_constructor]` attribute and the `Instance::emplace` constructor:

```rust
use gdnative::prelude::*;

#[derive(NativeClass)]
#[inherit(Reference)]
#[no_constructor] // This instructs the library to not ask for a default constructor. Instead, it will fail and return an unusable instance when an attempt is made to construct it from another language.
struct MyScript {
    foo: OpaqueRustType,
}

impl MyScript {
    /// It is, however, possible to move an existing value of this type from Rust onto a new object of the base class
    pub fn create_instance(foo: OpaqueRustType) -> Instance<Self, Shared> {
        Instance::emplace(Self { foo }).into_shared()
    }
}

// One may then export operations to Godot without having to worry about potentially invalid instances themselves.
#[methods]
impl MyScript {
    #[export]
    fn exotic_operation(&self, _owner: TRef<Reference>) -> i32 {
        self.foo.exotic_operation()
    }
}
```

A full changelog is included down below.

This release is made from tag [`0.9.3`](https://github.com/godot-rust/godot-rust/tree/0.9.3), commit [`574e0f7`](https://github.com/godot-rust/godot-rust/commit/574e0f7bca7fd21738331316746f7bdd2844d44f).

# Changelog

### Added

- Added `Instance::emplace`, a constructor that moves an existing script struct onto a new object.

- Added `Ref::by_class_name`, a method to construct Godot objects from class names.

- Added methods to recover `Ref`s or `TRef`s from instance IDs.

- Added a `Default` implementation for `NodePath`.

- Added `Add`, `AddAssign`, `Ord`, `PartialOrd`, `Index` implementations for `GodotString`.

- Added convenience methods for getting typed nodes in `gdnative-bindings`.

- Added examples for custom node plugins and Godot networking.

- Added the `#[property(no_editor)]` flag, which exports properties that can be accessed from other languages like GDScript, but aren't shown in the editor.

### Changed

- **The minimum compatible engine version is now 3.2-stable.**

- Improved readability of generated documentation for the API methods.

- Improved error messages for failed method calls.

- Proc-macros now emit compile errors rather than panic, improving the development experience.

- Documented the trade-offs of using `GodotString` vs. the `std` `String` type.

### Fixed

- `Object::callv` is now correctly marked as `unsafe`.

- Derive macro for `FromVariant` now correctly uses the actual variant name when reporting errors for enums.

- Derive macro for `OwnerToVariant` now correctly takes ownership of `self`.
