# GDNative + Godot

For questions about using the Godot engine and the GDNative bindings, the `#gdnative-dev` channel on the [Godot Engine community Discord server](https://godotengine.org/community) can be used. For IRC users, there is a `#godotengine-gdnative` channel on freenode, which is bridged with the aforementioned Discord channel.

A third option to communicate with Godot devs and user is the [Godot Contributors Chat](https://chat.godotengine.org/).


# godot-rust

Primary communication between developers of the project happens on the [**godot-rust** Discord server](https://discord.gg/FNudpBD). Developers looking to contribute are encouraged to join this server to discuss changes with maintainers and other contributors.

To follow development, we maintain the [@GodotRust](https://twitter.com/GodotRust) Twitter account. We share regular progress on the development, occasional anecdotes as well as highlights on projects built with godot-rust.
